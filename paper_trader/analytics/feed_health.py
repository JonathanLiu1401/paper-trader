"""Signal-feed health — is the live trader actually *seeing* any news?

The mature analytics layer measures everything *about* the trader's behaviour
once a decision is made — ``decision_health`` (decision rate),
``decision_forensics`` (why a parse failed), ``decision_drought`` /
``capital_paralysis`` (the alpha cost of sitting pinned),
``signal_followthrough`` (did it act on the signals it saw),
``news_edge`` / ``source_edge`` (do the signals predict the move). Every one of
them assumes the trader *received* signals. None answer the prior question an
operator actually has when the book just HOLDs for hours:

    *Is the news feed even reaching the trader, or is it flying blind?*

``strategy.decide()`` builds Opus's prompt from
``signals.get_top_signals(hours=2, min_score=4.0)`` against the article DB that
``signals._db_path()`` resolves to. If that DB is stale the prompt's
``TOP SCORED SIGNALS`` block is empty, ``store.record_decision`` writes
``signal_count = 0``, and the trader HOLDs forever — silently, because a
0-signal HOLD looks identical to a deliberate one in every existing panel.
``/api/data-feed`` reports raw ``articles_1h`` / ``articles_24h`` counts but no
verdict, no path resolution, and no link to the decision log — a stale-feed
reading of ``articles_24h: 3801`` looks healthy.

This module's marginal contribution over ``/api/data-feed`` is exactly the
three dimensions that make the failure *visible and actionable*: the
**consecutive 0-signal decision streak** (the trader is provably blind, not
merely between news), the **resolved DB path + its newest-live-article age**
(where the trader is actually reading from, and how stale it is), and
**split-brain detection** — ``signals._db_path()`` prefers the USB mount
first while digital-intern's daemon and ``unified_dashboard._articles_db_path``
prefer the local copy first, so when the USB mirror goes stale the two halves
of the system resolve ``articles.db`` with *opposite precedence* and the trader
silently consumes a frozen mirror while every other surface reads the fresh
one.

Pure / deterministic: the builder takes the decision list and a ``feed`` dict
of already-resolved DB stats (the endpoint does all SQLite / filesystem IO,
mirroring the ``thesis_drift`` / ``self_review`` "network lives in the
endpoint, builder takes the dicts" shape). Advisory only — it never gates the
trader and adds no caps (AGENTS.md invariants #2 / #12); ``restart_recommended``
is an operator hint, not a control signal.
